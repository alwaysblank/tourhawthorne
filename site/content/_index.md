**For summer 2021, Hawthorne Ghost Tour is now offering private tours!**

The fine print: Private tour tickets are $40 per person. All tour guests must wear their mask while on the tour. Tour groups must be at least 2 people and no more than 6 people. Tours happen on your schedule, as long as we have availability.

**The Hawthorne Ghost Tour** is a fun, exciting, and educational adventure through the heart of East Portlandâ€™s old red light district. This is a walking tour that takes between 1.5 and 2 hours, during which we will walk approximately a mile and a half. 

We have frequent stops to tell spooky and real-life stories about Portland and the Pacific Northwest, and we attempt to make contact with the hereafter at two separate locations, weather permitting.

The tour meets at the SE corner of 37th and SE Hawthorne, outside the historic Bagdad Theater. We have tours at 7:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. As one of the most popular tours in the Southeast, we do not accept walk-ups. We take most major holidays off. 

Tickets are $20 for adults, $10 for kids 7-12, and $12 for seniors and veterans. Call Marina at [714-675-1124](tel:714-675-1124) or email [marina \[at] mtourguideforhire \[dot] com](mailto:marina@tourguideforhire.com) for booking info. We take cash, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and PayPal.

We recommend leaving 15 minutes earlier than navigation software suggests; parking is sometimes hard to find. Please have your tickets available for the guide to check.
