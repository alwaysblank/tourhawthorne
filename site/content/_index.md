## We're Back!


The Hawthorne Ghost Tour is a fun, exciting, and educational adventure through the heart of East Portlandâ€™s most haunted street. 

This is a walking tour that takes between 1.5 and 2 hours, during which we will walk approximately a mile and a half. We have frequent stops to tell spooky and real-life stories about Portland and the Pacific Northwest

The tour meets at the SE corner of 37th and SE Hawthorne, outside the historic Bagdad Theater. We have tours Thursdays through Sundays with an extra-special costume extravaganza on Halloween night. As one of the most popular tours in the Southeast, we do not accept walk-ups. We take most major holidays off.

We recommend leaving 15 minutes earlier than navigation software suggests; parking is sometimes hard to find.
