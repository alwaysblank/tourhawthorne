The Hawthorne Ghost Tour has been owned and operated by [Marina Martinez-Bateman (They/Them)](http://marinaforhire.com/) since November 2014 when they bartered the previous owners for it. 

Marina is joined by guides from the local community. Guides keep all their tips, and tipping is encouraged as a way to show the guide how much you enjoyed the tour. 

Press inquiries: Please call Marina at 714-675-1124 or email marina [at] tourguideforhire [dot] com.
