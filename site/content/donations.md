## If you are seeking donations
The Ghost Tour loves to donate to auctions and other charitable events in Portland. Email marina at marina [at] marinaforhire [dot] com to request a donation.

## Donation Matching: Free Tickets
The Ghost Tour has a 1 to 1 matching for charitable donations up to the cost of a free ticket.

This means that when you show a donation receipt from an established local 501(c)3 you will get up to $20 in credit towards a free ticket. 

So a $15 donation can be a free veteran ($12 value), senior ($12 value) or child ticket ($10 value) or $15 off an adult ticket ($20 value) while a $30 donation is good for one adult ticket ($20 value).

Large donations above $200 can be converted into private group tours, one tour per donation.

Charitable organizations must be from the Portland Metro area and must have a 501(c)3.
