## If you are seeking donations

The Ghost Tour loves to donate to auctions and other charitable events in Portland. Email marina at marina [at] tourguideforhire [dot] com to request a donation. 

## Donation Matching: Free Tickets

The Ghost Tour has a 1 to 1 matching for charitable donations up to the cost of a free ticket. 

This means that when you show a donation reciept from an established local 501(c)3 you will get 100% of that cost back in free ghost tour tickets, up to the cost of that ticket. 

So a $15 donation can be a free veteran ($12 value), senior ($12 value) or child ticket ($10 value) or $15 off an adult ticket ($20 value) while a $30 donation is good for one adult ticket ($20 value). 

Large donations can be converted into private group tours, one tour per donation. 

Charitable organizations must be from the Portland Metro area and must have a 501(c)3
