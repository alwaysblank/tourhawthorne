**The Hawthorne Ghost Tour** is a fun, exciting, and educational adventure through the heart of East Portlandâ€™s old red light district. This is a walking tour that takes between 1.5 and 2 hours, during which we will walk approximately a mile and a half. We have frequent stops to tell spooky and real-life stories about Portland and the Pacific Northwest, and we attempt to make contact with the hereafter at two separate locations, weather permitting.

The tour meets at the SE corner of 37th and SE Hawthorne. We have tours at 7:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. As one of the most popular tours in the Southeast, we do take walk-ups, but we have to limit size to 20 people per tour. We take most major Holidays off. 

Tickets are $20 for adults, $10 for kids 7-12, and $12 for seniors and veterans. Call Marina at [714-675-1124](tel:714-675-1124) or email [marina@tourguideforhire.com](mailto:marina@tourguideforhire.com) for booking info. We take cash, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and PayPal.

Please have your tickets available for the guide to check.
